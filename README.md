# RHSoftwareReplacement
A serial application that communicates with the RH Systems 373, 473, 974 chilled mirrors.
This application is designed to automatically calibrate the GEO Calibration humidity generators (for calibration and testing of other devices). Note difference from humidifiers which are used to control atmospheric humidity whereas humidity generators create a set temperature and humidity within a testing chamber.

The application produces .cvs log files and displays real-time graphs.

Feel free to use this code however you'd like.
This is an application demonstraiting the use of JSSC serial library and Swing
